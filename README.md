ColorMatch is a fun and interactive game where players mix two colors to match the dominant color of a reference image. Adjust the color ratios, experiment with different shades, and see how close you can get to the perfect match. 

So, what can this mini-game do? Let’s break it down:

1. You can choose two colors.

3. Mix them in any proportion you like.
4. Try to match the mixed color to the main color in the reference image.

6. Repeat the process — or try a different image for a new challenge!

This project was inspired by the HTML Color Mixer(https://htmlcolors.com/color-mixer), which allows users to experiment with mixing colors in different proportions.
